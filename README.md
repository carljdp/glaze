## Getting started

`start` is a reserved word, so we can't use that.
`run` is a cross-platform wrapper to start `main`

| Terminal        | Start Command         |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Command Line    | `run[.bat]`           |
| PowerShell      | `./run[.bat]`         |
| GitBash / MinGW | `[.\|source] [./]run` |
